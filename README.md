Package Analysis is a powerful Android APP  analysis toolkit.
Package Analysis is a comprehensive and powerful Android application management and analysis toolkit designed for developers, power users, and tech enthusiasts. It goes far beyond a typical app manager, providing an in-depth, granular view into both installed applications and standalone APK files. With a clean, modern interface built on Google's Material Design, Package Analysis offers a suite of sophisticated tools for inspecting, managing, and interacting with the software on your device.

Whether you're debugging your own app, exploring the contents of a third-party package, or managing system bloatware, Package Analysis provides the necessary tools with precision and clarity.

Core Features

Once an application is installed, Package Analysis allows you to inspect every facet of its composition:

Detailed App Info: View essential information, including version name, version code, target SDK, minimum SDK, installation date, and more.

Manifest Viewer: A built-in, human-readable viewer for the AndroidManifest.xml file, revealing the core configuration of any app.

Permissions Explorer: List all declared permissions, check their status, and understand what capabilities an app is requesting.

Component Breakdown: Browse all registered Activities, Services, Receivers, and Providers within an application.

Powerful APK Inspector and Installer

Package Analysis serves as a robust tool for handling standalone package files (.apk, .apks, .xapk, etc.) before they are even installed.

Pre-Installation Analysis: Open any APK file to view its app name, package ID, permissions, and digital certificate information before committing to an installation.

Split APKs Support: Seamlessly handles the installation of split APKs and bundled formats like .apks, .apkm, and .xapk through a user-friendly file picker.

Custom Installation Interface: A dedicated installer screen provides real-time status updates during the installation process, confirming success or failure with clarity.
